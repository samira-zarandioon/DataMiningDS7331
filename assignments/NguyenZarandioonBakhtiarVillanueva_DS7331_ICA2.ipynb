With this set to none, this will go until the leaves are pure or until the parameter for the minimum samples necessary for a leaf node is hit. Conversely, min_samples_split can be used to control overgrowth by specifying that a leaf must contain at least a certain number of samples before splitting. Another parameter to control growth would be min_impurity decrease. This will split the node if splitting it according to the specified value makes it more pure."
